## 🎯 Project Overview

This project transforms 7,043 customer records into actionable retention insights across four key dimensions:
- **Contract Analysis**: Churn patterns by commitment level and their revenue implications
- **Service Portfolio**: Internet service impact on retention and customer satisfaction
- **Customer Demographics**: Senior citizen behavior and tenure relationship to churn
- **Data Quality**: Systematic handling of missing data and type mismatches

**Key Finding**: Electronic check users show 45.29% churn—3x higher than automatic payment methods (15-17%)—while fiber optic customers churn at 41.89% despite premium pricing. Month-to-month contracts drive 87% of monthly revenue loss ($120.85K of $139.13K total).
